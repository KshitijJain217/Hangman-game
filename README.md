# Hangman-game
The provided code is a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game. In this game:

A random word is chosen from a predefined list.
1.The player is tasked with guessing the word one letter at a time.
2.The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (lives), represented by a Hangman graphic that evolves with each wrong guess.
3.Correctly guessed letters are revealed in their correct positions within the word.
4.The player wins if they guess all the letters in the word before running out of lives.
5.The player loses if they exhaust all their lives before guessing the word.
The game includes checks to prevent repeated guesses and provides feedback on the number of lives remaining, the current state of the word, and the Hangman's current stage.
